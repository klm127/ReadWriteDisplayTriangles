toDo

Delete fields from UI that I dont need now with the better Save/Load interface

Implement spinner bars for integer values 

Add a name to the files/recordTable

Add a Color field to the file saves and the triangles

Consider a border Pane for the triangle pane in the top area for a few buttons.
Add an actionListener to the TrianglePane? maybe for mouseovers that would display a triangles name when you mouse over it
	Could also implement a way to drag triangles and save them in their new Coordinates
	
	How about - Drag Triangles around and spin the mouse wheel to rotate them 


implement drop down file selector / text field


move record filling from fileGenerator to recordTable

Transforms

Colors
